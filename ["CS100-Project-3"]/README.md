#Polynomial Function Handler

I created a header file of functions to handle polynomials. Poly.c & poly.h were my personal work.

 p3.c is used to test poly.c and was not created by me. Neither were the scanner.c & scanner.h files. 

I only created the poly.c and poly.h header file to create a support for working with polynomials.
