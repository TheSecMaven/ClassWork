Words.c will find all occurences of any word that is in the puzzle that is inputted as a file.
Junk.dat is a test file. 
to compile, argv[1] should be the number of rows and argv[2] should be the file.

The program does not correctly print out where all the occurences of the word or words are. it is inconsistent. 
However, it does produce the correct number of occurences.
